- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    My initial impressions of how 'Inheritance' affects my programming is that inheritance definitely makes it easier to create programs with several similar classes because it sort of standardizes the process by using the super class as a model. I really enjoyed learning how to implement inheritance in my code!

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Starting early 100% worked for me. For this assignment, I started the earliest that I have during this class, which was extremely beneficial because it allowed me to focus less on the time constraint and more on working through the code at my own pace instead of frantically. To someone taking this course in the future, I would say just start. It can be really intimidating to even open an assignment sometimes and super easy to put it off, but you will feel so much better once you start. This is especially true if you start as early as you can because then you even have a possibility of finishing early and having that weight off of your shoulders.
